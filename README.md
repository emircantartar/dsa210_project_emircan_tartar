DSA210 Project for Fall 24-25 by Emircan Tartar

YouTube Watching History Analysis

Project Overview:

This project aims to explore my YouTube watching history to uncover patterns in my viewing habits and analyze channel preferences and loyalty. By examining this data, I will gain insights into my peak viewing times and my loyalty to specific channels, offering a data-driven perspective on my personal content consumption habits.

Dataset Description:

The dataset comprises my YouTube watching history, with each entry representing a video watched. It includes the following key attributes:

watch_time: The timestamp of when each video was watched. This field allows for analysis of time-based viewing patterns, such as identifying peak watching hours or days of the week.
video_title: The title of the watched video. This field can help identify the content type or genre of each video, offering insights into favored topics.
video_url: The unique URL for each video watched. This allows for categorizing or revisiting videos for specific analyses.
channel_name: The name of the YouTube channel from which the video was watched. This field is essential for exploring channel preferences and examining any patterns in channel loyalty.

Project Objectives:

This project will focus on two main areas:

Viewing Patterns Analysis:

Analyze daily and hourly patterns in my YouTube viewing habits to understand my peak watching times.
Explore seasonal or day-of-week patterns to see if there are consistent trends over time.
Channel Preference and Loyalty:
Identify the channels I watch most frequently to understand my preferences.
Assess my loyalty to specific channels by analyzing recurring views and possible shifts in channel interests over time.

Project Plan and Timeline:

Data Exploration (November 30, 2024):
Load the dataset and conduct an initial exploration to understand the data structure and identify any data cleaning needs.
Document key observations from the data exploration phase in this repository.

Viewing Patterns Analysis (Early December 2024):
Analyze and visualize viewing times, identifying peak watching periods, including hours of the day and days of the week.
Investigate if certain time frames correlate with specific content or channels.

Channel Preference and Loyalty Analysis (Mid-December 2024):
Calculate the frequency of views per channel to determine my top channels.
Visualize channel preferences and assess channel loyalty by examining repeat views and trends over time.

Insights and Summary Report (End of December 2024):
Compile findings from both analyses into a final report.
Document any observed trends, insights into viewing habits, and patterns of channel loyalty.

Final Repository Submission (End of December 2024):
Ensure that all code, analysis, and documentation are updated in the repository for final submission.
