#YouTube Watching History Analysis

##Project Overview:

This project explores my YouTube-watching history to uncover patterns in my viewing habits and analyze channel preferences and loyalty. By examining this data, I aim to gain insights into my peak viewing times and my loyalty to specific channels, offering a data-driven perspective on my content consumption habits.

##Motivation:

As video content consumption becomes an increasingly significant part of daily life, understanding personal viewing habits can offer valuable insights. Analyzing my own YouTube watching history allows me to identify when I watch videos the most and which types of content and channels capture my attention. This analysis could reveal trends in my interests over time, helping me understand how I engage with different types of content on the platform.

##Main Research Questions:

This project will address the following questions:

###Viewing Patterns:

-What are my peak viewing times across different days and hours?
-Do my viewing habits show any consistent patterns based on the day of the week or time of day?

###Channel Preference and Loyalty:
-Which channels do I watch most frequently, and are there specific channels I consistently return to?
-How does my engagement with channels change over timeâ€”are there shifts in my preferred channels or new favorites emerging?

##Dataset Description:

The dataset includes my YouTube watching history, each representing a video I watched. It contains the following attributes:

-watch_time: The timestamp of each video watched, allowing analysis of time-based patterns, such as peak watching hours and days of the week.
-video_title: The title of the watched video, is useful for identifying the type or genre of content.
-video_url: The unique URL of each video, enabling categorization or revisit analysis.
-channel_name: The name of the channel from which the video was watched, which is essential for analyzing channel preferences and assessing loyalty.

##Project Plan and Timeline:

###Data Exploration (November 30, 2024):
-Conduct initial data exploration to understand the structure, attributes, and any cleaning requirements.
-Document preliminary insights in this repository.

###Viewing Patterns Analysis (Early December 2024):
-Analyze viewing times to identify peak hours and days of the week.
-Explore correlations between watching times and types of content.

###Channel Preference and Loyalty Analysis (Mid-December 2024):
-Calculate view frequencies per channel to determine top channels.
-Assess channel loyalty by identifying repeat views and shifts in preferences over time.

###Insights and Summary Report (End of December 2024):
-Compile findings into a final report, documenting trends and insights from both analyses.

###Final Repository Submission (End of December 2024):
-Ensure all analysis, code, and documentation are finalized in the repository for grading.
